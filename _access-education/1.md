        <h3>Find the contact details of the school</h3>
        <p>Use our <a href="/docs/wc-school-search.html">school search</a> to find the email address and telephone number of the school you want to contact.</p>
        <h3>Writing the letter</h3>
        <p>In order to take this matter further you need to request a formal letter from the school stating why your child was denied access. We've created <a href="">a draft letter</a> you can use as a starting point. Make sure to fill our all the relevant details and send it to the head of the school(s) your child was denied access from.</p>

        <h3>Following up with the school</h3>
        <p>The process of getting the letter often takes between 6 and 7 weeks. You can use our <a href="">handy reminder service</a> to help you remember to follow up with the school in due course.</p>

        <h3>How can the school governing body help?</h3>
        <p>If the school principal rejected your application because the school is unable to cater for your child’s special-needs, then the governing body might be able to intervene. For example, if your child needs wheelchair access, and the school does not cater for this, then they could deny access. In this case the governing body could adjust the school’s budget to make accomodations for the work required to add wheelchair access.</p>
