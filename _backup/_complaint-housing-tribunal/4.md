        <i class="fa-li fa fa-info-circle"></i>Tip: You might get a phone call from a Tribunal staff member. If they call, ask them for their name and for your case reference number. Ask if they have sent the letter and ask for the contact details of the case officer assigned to your matter.  If you do not hear anything after two weeks, call the Rental Housing Tribunal to follow-up. Keep following up regularly.
