        <h3>The waste contractor in your area</h3>
         <li>If you haven't been introduced to the contractor in your area, try asking your neighbours if they know and can introduce you</li>
         <li>If none of your neighbours know, try finding some of the waste collection workers - they should live in the same area, they might even be your neighbour!</li>
         <li>If you are still unable to find your contractor, enlist the help of your ward councillor</li>
