        <i class="fa-li fa fa-info-circle"></i>Sometimes a land owner or landlord may try to prevent you from entering your home to force you to leave. This is known to be "obstructing you from entering". This could happen by them putting a security guard at the entrance, or even by using bricks or a gate. A landlord might also change the locks to your home. These are acts of intimidation and harassment and are are illegal in terms of the Rental Housing Act and the Unfair Practice Regulations. Section 3 of the Unfair Practice Regulations state that: <br>
        (1) A landlord or tenant may not change any locks providing access to the dwelling concerned â€”<br>
        (a) unless it is necessary due to fair wear and tear or other reasonable causes;<br>
        (b) without reasonable notice of the proposed change to the other party; and<br>
        (c) unless duplicate keys are provided to the other party immediately upon such change of locks;

        (d) " engage in oppressive or unconscionable conduct towards the tenant;" <br>
        (f) "conduct any activity which unreasonably interferes with or limits the rights of the tenant or which is expressly prohibited under the lease, the Act and these regulations, any ordinance, health or safety regulations or any other law;"
