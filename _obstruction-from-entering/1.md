      <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-info-circle"></i>A land owner or landlord may try to prevent you from entering your home to force you to leave. This is known to be "obstructing you from entering".</li>
      <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-info-circle"></i>This could happen by them putting a security guard at the entrance, or even by using bricks or a gate.</li>
      <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-info-circle"></i>A landlord might also change the locks to your home.</li>
      <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></i><strong>This is illegal!</strong></li>
      <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-info-circle"></i>Whenever something is done to force you out of your property without a court order, this is called a constructive eviction. </li>
      <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-info-circle"></i>Sometimes landlords or landowners force you to leave by cutting off services, locking you out, sending you threatening SMSes, or sending someone to scare you.</li>
      <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-info-circle"></i>A landlord or land owner cannot intimidate you to leave the property or force you to move out.</li>
      <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-gavel"></i>This is illegal in terms of the Constitution, PIE Act, The Rental Housing Act and the Unfair Practice Regulations.</li>
