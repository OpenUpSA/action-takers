      <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-comments-o"></i>Attempt to have a conversation and allow both sides to try and understand the circumstances and resolve the matter. There are many different things that can cause an eviction.</li>
      <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-gavel"></i>If meaningful engagement does not happen, or you canâ€™t resolve the issue, the legal process will start. This is when the court gets involved
</li>
      <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-trash-o"></i>The day your rubbish is collected depends on where you live. The City of Cape Town has created <a target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/waste-collection-schedule">a map of waste collection times</a>. If you're not sure in which area your house falls we suggest asking your neighbours. If they are not sure either, contact the municipality at <a href="mailto:wastewise@capetown.gov.za">wastewise@capetown.gov.za</a> or <a href="tel:0860103089">0860103089</a></li>
      <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-trash-o"></i>If your wheelie bin has been stolen or is missing you can get one from the city. Go to the City of Cape Town website for <a href="http://bit.ly/request-wheelie-bin">detailed information about how to apply for one</a></li>
