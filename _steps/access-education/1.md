      <p>Schools are not allowed to discriminate against learners during the admission process. If you have been refused admission to all schools you have applied to, in order to take this matter further you need to request a formal letter from the school stating why your child was denied access. Please note that this process often takes between 6 and 7 weeks, so use our handy reminder service to follow up in due course. </p>

          <p>If the school principal rejected your application because the school is unable to cater for your child’s special-needs, then the governing body might be able to intervene. For example, if your child needs wheelchair access, and the school does not cater for this, then they could deny access. In this case the governing body could adjust the school’s budget to make accomodations for your the work required to add wheelchair access.</p>
