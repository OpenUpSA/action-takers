      <p>Schools are not allowed to discriminate against learners during the admission process. If you have been refused admission to all schools you have applied to, in order to take this matter further you need to request a formal letter from the school stating why your child was denied access. Please note that this process often takes between 6 and 7 weeks, so use our handy reminder service to follow up in due course. </p>
