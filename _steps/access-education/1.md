for: Read on if you and your child have unsuccessfully applied to the school of your choice

- Schools are <b>not allowed to discriminate</b> against learners during the admission process
- A parent has the <b>right to choose which school</b> their child can attend
- Write a request to the school, asking them for the reasons why admission has been declined
- If you are not sure of the school's contact details, use our <a target="_blank" href="/docs/wc-school-search.html">school finder</a> to get the email address and telephone number of the school you want to contact
- In order to take this matter further you need to request a formal letter from the school stating why your child was denied access. We've created <a href="">a draft letter</a> you can use as a starting point. Make sure to fill our all the relevant details and send it to the head of the school(s) your child was denied access from
- The process of getting the letter often takes between 6 and 7 weeks. Remember to follow up with the school in due course.
- If the school principal rejected your application because the school is unable to cater for your child’s special-needs, then the governing body might be able to intervene. For example, if your child needs wheelchair access, and the school does not cater for this, then they could deny access. In this case the governing body could adjust the school’s budget to make accomodations for the work required to add wheelchair access
