      <p>The school governing body is made up of parents, educators, non-teaching staff and learners. They are responsible for ensuring the school is run efficiently and meets the needs of the community.</p>
      <p>Some governing bodies don’t know that they are legally required to cater for children with special-needs, so making them aware of this can help.</p>

          <p>If the school principal rejected your application because the school is unable to cater for your child’s special-needs, then the governing body might be able to intervene. For example, if your child needs wheelchair access, and the school does not cater for this, then they could deny access. In this case the governing body could adjust the school’s budget to make accomodations for your the work required to add wheelchair access.</p>
