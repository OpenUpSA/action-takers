- Contractors have specified collection days
- The municipality is responsible to ensure that residents of an area are aware of who the contractor is and what the collection days are
- Contractors and the City's project manager will introduce themselves to residents
- Contractors are introduced to the local sub-council and ward councillors prior to commencement of work
- If you haven't been introduced to the contractor in your area, try asking your neighbours if they know and can introduce you
- If none of your neighbours know, try finding some of the waste collection workers - they should live in the same area, they might even be your neighbour!
- If you are still unable to find your contractor, enlist the help of your ward councillor
