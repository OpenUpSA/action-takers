- To apply for the grant you will have to go to your nearest SASSA district office or counter service point with all your supporting documentation. The application for the social assistance grants is free and the process should take approximately 2 hours.

- **TIP:** If you are unable to go to the office yourself you may have a friend or family member apply on your behalf; with letter from you as
applicant authorizing the application. Alternatively you may call the SASSA office to request a home visit, although you may wait a while for this.

- Once at the office you will be required to fill in the application form in the presence of a SASSA officer. When your application is completed you
will be given a receipt. Keep this receipt - it is your only proof of application.
