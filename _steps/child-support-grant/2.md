title: Gather all the required documentation
for: As part of the application process, SASSA will request some documentation of you. This step describes what eligible people must bring with them when applying for a grant.

Remember to take all the following documents with you:
- Your ID book
- Your child’s birth certificate
- The ID of your spouse (if married)
- Proof of income and assets such as bank statements

If you do not have an ID or your child’s birth certificate, you can still make an application. You will need to produce a sworn statement or affidavit. SASSA will help you with the forms you need to complete these.
