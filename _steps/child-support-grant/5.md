- SASSA has up to 90 days to process your application. You might hear right away whether your application was successful, or you might need to wait. You will receive a letter sent to the address you completed on the form, informing you of the outcome of your application.
- **TIP!** If you move during the time from when you applied to when you expect to receive notification of the outcome, it is very important that you let SASSA know your new address. It is always important to keep all your contact details up to date with SASSA.
- You will be informed if your application was successful or not. If it wasnâ€™t successful, you can dispute that decision by talking to a SASSA official.
- If successful, your first payment will include any back-pay owing since the date of application.
- If you want to follow up on your application you can contact SASSA on their free helpline on [0800 601 011](tel:0800601011).
