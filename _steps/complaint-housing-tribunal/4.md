for: If you have submitted your complaint forms to the tribunal, received your case number and are wondering what happens next then you might find this information useful

- About two weeks after receiving your case number, you and your landlord should receive a letter from the Tribunal. This letter should say that your complaint has been received, and it should include your case reference number.
- Tip: You might get a phone call from a Tribunal staff member. If they call, ask them for their name and for your case reference number. Ask if they have sent the letter and ask for the contact details of the case officer assigned to your matter.  If you do not hear anything after two weeks, call the Rental Housing Tribunal to follow-up. Keep following up regularly.
