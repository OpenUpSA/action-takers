- Once your complaint has been received, tribunal staff check whether your complaint involves a dispute about something that may be an unfair practice. This check is called a preliminary investigation. If they think they need more details, they can ask for more information from you or your landlord to help them understand the complaint. Tribunal staff can also get an inspector to inspect the property.
