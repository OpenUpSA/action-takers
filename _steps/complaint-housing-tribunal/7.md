- Your case is given a case officer. This case officer is someone who is supposed to contact you and the landlord. They might first try to come to a solution by calling you and your landlord to discuss the issue.
- The case officer then decides whether the dispute can be solved through mediation, or a hearing. Mediation is a meeting where both sides try to come to an agreement after discussing the problem, with the help of a neutral person from the Tribunal. A hearing is where both parties share the facts of their dispute to members of the Tribunal board who will make a ruling.
- TIP: Check your phone and email regularly. The case officer will try to contact you about whether you should attend mediation or a hearing.
