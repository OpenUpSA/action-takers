for: If you have been in contact with your case officer and they have suggested mediation then you might find this information useful

- If the case officer thinks that the dispute can be solved by mediation, they will contact you to set up an appointment. A member of the Tribunal staff facilitates the mediation as the mediator. The mediator does not come up with the solutions, but helps the two parties come to their own solution. You can have a lawyer or someone else help you in mediation, but it is not necessary.  In the mediation, the mediator listens to both parties and asks questions to help them come to an agreement. If you come to an agreement, you sign the agreement and both parties do what was agreed to. If you do not come to an agreement, the next step is to have a hearing.
- TIP: If you need a translator or have a disability, let your case officer know before the mediation or hearing.
