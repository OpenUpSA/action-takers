- You will be given a hearing date by your case officer. The hearing will be held at the Tribunal offices at 27 Wale Street.  In the hearing, each party is asked to share the facts of their case. At least three Tribunal members will be present at the hearing. They ask the parties questions, and may ask for certain documents to be shown. It is not as formal as a court, and you do not need to have lawyers or legal representation.  After hearing both sides, the Tribunal members make a ruling.  This is a decision about whether there was an unfair practice. The ruling is communicated to the parties a few days after the hearing. The ruling has the same power as a ruling by a Magistrateâ€™s Court. If you or the landlord wants to challenge the decision, you have to go to the High Court as soon as possible.
- Tip: Make sure you have copies of all the documents that you need for your case when you attend the hearing. This includes receipts, proof of WhatsApp messages or SMSs, copies of lease agreements etc.
