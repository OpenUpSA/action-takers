### Five things you need to know about a spoliation order
- A spoliation is a remedy used when one’s "peaceful and undisturbed possession" has been disrupted illegally. "Peaceful and undisturbed possession" means that you have been living in your home without anyone trying to kick you out.
- A spoliation application is URGENT in nature and will usually require legal assistance (a lawyer). URGENT means you must go to court as soon as you can - if you can, go immediately!
- Its object is to return possession to the person who was deprived (evicted), and is based on the principle that no person should take the law into their own hands.
- A spoliation order is final. This means neither the tenant nor the landlord  can challenge the judges decision.
- A spoliation is an application procedure which means that evidence is filed by an affidavit and presented to the Magistrate in Court. You do not need to stand up in court and testify.
