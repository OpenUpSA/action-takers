- Phone the City of Cape Town at [0860 103 089](tel:0860103089) to find out if they have switched off the water or if they know  of any faults with the water meter. If the City has nothing on its system, they will often send someone out to have a look within 24-48 hours. If they find no faults, it is likely your water has been cut off by the landlord.
