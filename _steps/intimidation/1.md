- A landlord may try to intimidate you through calls, messages or other ways to make you feel uncomfortable or scared as a tactic to get you to move out. The landlord may also get someone else to intimidate, harass or threaten you
- Communicate with your landlord and tell them that intimidation to make you leave is against the law, and that they should stop. Keep a record of all the messages or calls.
