title: Apply for a protection order
for: If you are being harassed by your landlord and want to take legal action this step is for you
---
- To apply for a protection order you can go to <a href="https://www.westerncape.gov.za/directories/facilities/908">your nearest police station</a> or <a href="https://www.westerncape.gov.za/directories/facilities/1132">magistrates court</a>. If you do go to a police station you may be directed to a court for assistance with filling out the form. You do not need legal representation for this process.
- You will first be required to <a href="http://www.justice.gov.za/forms/pha/J037-form1.pdf">fill in an Information Notice</a> which explains how the process work and notifies you of your right to lodge a criminal complaint.
- TIP: If you want a form that is not in English follow <a href="http://www.justice.gov.za/forms/form_pha.html">this link</a> and scroll down to the bottom of the page where you will be given language options for the J37 form/Form 1.
- Once you have read and signed the Information Notice, you will be required to fill in <a href="http://www.justice.gov.za/forms/pha/J059-form2.pdf">The Application for Protection Order</a>.
- TIP: You should  include a list of  the specific acts committed by your landlord in the protection order. You are also able to request that the court impose any additional conditions necessary to ensure your safety and well-being.
- The court may, after considering the application, issue an <a href="http://www.justice.gov.za/forms/pha/J062-form3.pdf">interim protection order</a> against your landlord even if they have not been given notice of the proceedings. The court must, however, be satisfied that there is evidence that the landlord is engaging, or has engaged in harassment; harm is or may be suffered by you (the complainant) as a result of such conduct if a protection order is not issued immediately; and the protection to be accorded by the interim protection order is likely not to be achieved if prior notice of the application is given to your landlord (the respondent).
