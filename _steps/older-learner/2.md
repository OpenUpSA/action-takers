- Apply to three ordinary public Secondary schools. If there is a full service Secondary school in your local area, include this school in your application process.
- It is compulsory for ALL children between the ages of 7 and 15 to be in school.
- [Section 2 (3) of the South African Schools Act](https://www.gdeadmissions.gov.za/Content/Files/SchoolsAct.pdf) (SASA) states that:

> Every parent must cause every learner for whom he or she is responsible to attend a school from the first school day of the year in which such a learner reaches the age of seven years until the last school day of the year in which such learner reaches the age of fifteen years or the ninth grade, whichever occurs first.
