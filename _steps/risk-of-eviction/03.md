- The Section 4(2) notice is a legal document that has to be served by the Sheriff to those being evicted. It is served to you with the Notice of Motion.
- The Notice of Motion and the Section 4(2) notice look the same in form and contain the same information.
- The only difference is that one is a notice of motion in terms of Section 4(1) and the other is a notice of service in terms of Section 4(2).
