- A supplementary affidavit is a document where the occupiers (the RESPONDENTS) will have a chance to respond to any new matters that have come up during the legal proceedings.
- This is a chance to reply to the applicant's replying affidavit, the affidavit by the City as well as a chance to add anything you might have left out of your opposing affidavit.
- **TIP!** Remember an eviction matter is an application procedure. This means everything is argued on papers and not by witnesses. Itâ€™s important to provide ALL information in your affidavit.
