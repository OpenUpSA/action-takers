- Once all the documents have been filed in court, a date is given for the court hearing. A court hearing is where the arguments between the APPLICANTS and RESPONDENTS are heard by a judge.
- In a hearing, everything that has been placed on affidavit will be argued in court.
- Once the court has heard all the information, the judge will make an ORDER. They will take into consideration all the relevant factors.  If the judge decides to evict you, they will issue a court order.
