- A court order is a decision by a judge. In an eviction, the court order must be communicated to you in a document by the sheriff.  The court order will give you a date when you have to be evicted by.
- A court order is LAWFUL when all the correct proceedings mentioned above have been followed.
- Only once a court has made an order, can a SHERIFF evict you.
