- Report your unlawful eviction immediately to the police, and [file an affidavit](http://www.nda.agric.za/doaDev/sideMenu/biosafety/doc/13.%20AFFIDAVIT%20PDF.pdf). Alert friends, civil society organizations like Reclaiming The City, and the media.
- TIP: A sworn affidavit is a written statement declared as the truth. It is signed in front of a Commissioner of Oaths. The South African Police Department (SAPS) can act as the Commissioner of Oaths and stamp the affidavit at the station.
- Find a [blank SAPS affidavit template](http://www.nda.agric.za/doaDev/sideMenu/biosafety/doc/13.%20AFFIDAVIT%20PDF.pdf). This can be downloaded, filled in and stamped at any police station. The form can also be obtained from the police station and completed by hand.
