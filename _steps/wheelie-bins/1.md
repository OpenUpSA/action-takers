- The municipality is responsible for solid waste removal on a weekly basis
- The municipality provides bins and bags for your waste to be removed
- The day your rubbish is collected depends on where you live. The City of Cape Town has created <a target="_blank" href="http://bit.ly/waste-collection-schedule">a map of waste collection times</a>. If you're not sure in which area your house falls we suggest asking your neighbours. If they are not sure either, contact the municipality at <a href="mailto:wastewise@capetown.gov.za">wastewise@capetown.gov.za</a> or <a href="tel:0860103089">0860103089</a>
- If your wheelie bin has been stolen or is missing you can get one from the city. Go to the City of Cape Town website for <a href="http://bit.ly/request-wheelie-bin">detailed information about how to apply for one</a>
