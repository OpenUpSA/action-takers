  <h3>What is Action Takers?</h3>
  <p>Actions Takers is community of civic-minded people who understand the role of public participation in our democracy and use that power to ensure their voices are heard. Action Takers contribute to communities' needs being represented and met and assist in co-creating the governance we want. This website is a collection of easy-to-use empowerment guides.</p>
  <p>These guides are classified into various categories and are named by the topic they address. Whilst this collection is by no means extensive, the aim is to grow the collection over time. Initially these guides are focused on the Cape Town area and are tailored for Cape Town specific processes.</p> 
  <p>We encourage people to use these guides, share them and provide feedback so that we can continually improve them. Our shared learnings are important and we want to hear your voice and your experience. For those who prefer to work with these guides offline, or who have no online access, these guides are also available in pdf and can be sent via WhatsApp too.</p>
